# Donate

The software hosted on this site ("Doc V Software Project") is <i>free</i> to download and use. There are no ads, popups, or links to products for sale. The software is maintained by myself (Frederick W. Vollmer) out of scholarly and academic interest, with no funding or support from university or other sources. 

The software has thousands of users at academic institutions, public and private agencies, and in industry and consulting. Rather than charging a fee, I have elected to offer it for <i>free</i>, and to move towards an open source model. The only stipulation is that citations of the author's work be included in publications containing content created by the software or derivative works.

While the software is <i>free</i>, I greatly appreciate donations. Donations are used to defray costs of software development and website hosting, and allow me to continue offering free software. The PayPal link below allows a secure donation to be made in US dollars. You do not need a PayPal account for a one time donation, an account is required to make monthly donations.[^1]
