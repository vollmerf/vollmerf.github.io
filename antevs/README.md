Antevs is a program for analyzing varve, tree-ring, and other time-series data. Fourier analysis, and other curve fitting algorithms, are used to remove trends and to normalize the data for comparison. The resulting data series are correlated using cross-correlation techniques to identify potential matches. 

Antevs is free software, with the stipulation that citation be given for usage as noted in the user manuals. It is available in compiled form for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Antevs is written and maintained by Frederick W. Vollmer.

### Example Correlation
![Example](images/Figure_04_web.png)

(A) Hudson and Connecticut River Valley raw (top) and detrended (bottom) North American Varve Chronology data (NAVC, see link on sidebar). The raw data is detrended using a 16 term Fourier filter to remove long wavelength variations, and standardized to account for thickness variations between proxmal and distal varves.

(B) Correlogram produced by cross-correlation of the detrended data in A. The correlogram shows a spike corresponding to a match at 0 years offset, with a correlation of r = 0.64, and significance t = 9.57.
