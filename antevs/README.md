[Antevs](https://www.frederickvollmer.com/antevs/) is a program for analyzing varve, tree-ring, and other time-series data. Fourier analysis, and other curve fitting algorithms, are used to remove trends and to normalize the data for comparison. The resulting data series are correlated using cross-correlation techniques to identify potential matches.
