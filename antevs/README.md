# Antevs 
Natural Time-Series Analysis Software

![Antevs](../images/AntevsIcon.png)

Antevs is a user friendly professional tool for correlating natural time-series. These arise where a value is measured through time at discrete intervals. Annual intervals commonly occur in natural systems due to seasonal variations in temperature, as displayed in proglacial varves, tree-rings, and glacial ice. Correlation is done by comparing an undated times-series to a previously dated chronology.

Antevs was developed for the correlation of proglacial varve sequences (Rayburn and Vollmer, 2013), but includes standard techniques for matching tree-rings, and can convert files between varve and tree-ring formats. It includes routines for reading the Velmex UniSlide digital readout used for digitizing tree-ring measurements. Missing data due to broken or incomplete cores is a common problem in natural data, so Antevs includes interactive procedures to correlate such sequences. 

Antevs undergoes extensive testing by varve and tree-ring researchers, including undergraduates, working in John Rayburn's varve and tree-ring laboratory at SUNY New Paltz. Antevs is compiled natively for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux, and does not require any additional libraries or interpreters.

## Example Correlation
![Example](images/Figure_04_web.png)

(A) Hudson and Connecticut River Valley raw (top) and detrended (bottom) North American Varve Chronology (NAVC) data. The raw data is detrended using a 16 term Fourier filter to remove long wavelength variations, and standardized to account for thickness variations between proxmal and distal varves.

(B) Correlogram produced by cross-correlation of the detrended data. The correlogram shows a spike corresponding to a match at 0 years offset, with a correlation of r = 0.64, and significance t = 9.57.
