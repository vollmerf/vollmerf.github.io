* [Orient](https://www.frederickvollmer.com/orient/)is for analyzing directional data, data that can be described by an axis or direction, or by a position on a sphere. Examples include latitude and longitude, star locations, bedding planes, fold axes, fault slip directions, paleomagnetic vectors, glacial striations, crystallographic axes, current flow directions, and whale migration paths. Kamb. Orient is used by many geologists, but is developed to be flexible for use in other disciplines requiring orientation data plotting and analysis.
