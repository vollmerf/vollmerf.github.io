<h1>Software</h1>
<p>
As a structural geologist, I spend my time studying and enjoying rock structures from microscopic crenulations to great rifts and mountain belts. I am, however, a compulsive computer programmer. The first geological software I wrote was a strain analysis program for <a href="http://www.atmos.albany.edu/geology/webpages/wdmeans.html">Win Means</a>, using punch cards and Fortran on a 1970s era mainframe. Computers and computing power quickly advance, and I have since used numerous compilers and languages. All of my software is compiled natively on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux, giving optimal performance on each platform.

<b><a href="http://www.frederickvollmer.com/orient/index.html">Orient</a></b>&nbsp;is for analyzing <i>orientation data</i>, data that can be described by an axis or direction, or by a position on a sphere or circle. Examples include latitude and longitude, star locations, bedding planes, fold axes, fault slip directions, paleomagnetic vectors, glacial striations, crystallographic axes, current flow directions, and whale migration paths. The program icon displays ice petrofabric axes from the Blue Mountain Glacier from a study by <a href="http://features.caltech.edu/features/167">W. Barclay Kamb</a>. Orient is used by many geologists, but is developed to be flexible for use in other disciplines requiring orientation data plotting and analysis.

<b><a href="http://www.frederickvollmer.com/ellipsefit/index.html">EllipseFit</a></b>&nbsp;is an integrated program for geological <i>fabric and finite strain analysis</i>. It includes routines to digitize and analyze point, line, ellipse, and polygon distributions to determine fabric and finite strain ellipses. It can be used to determine three-dimensional strain ellipsoids from oriented photographs, and is designed for field and laboratory structural geology studies. The graphical interface and multi-platform deployment also make it ideal for teaching in introductory structural geology laboratories.

<b><a href="antevs/index.html">Antevs</a></b>, Automated Numerical Time-series Evaluation of Varying Sequences, is a program for analyzing varve, tree-ring, and other time-series data. The program uses Fourier analysis, or other curve fitting algorithms, to remove trends and to normalize the data for comparison. The resulting data series are correlated using cross-correlation techniques to identify potential matches. Editing capabilities allow series renumbering once an unknown series is correlated with a known chronology.

<b><a href="pictracker/index.html">PicTracker</a></b>&nbsp;is a picture viewing application with tools for organizing large collections. It can quickly browse through folders of image files, and has a slide show mode to give instant full screen presentations. File organization tools include batch moving and deleting files, and batch renaming using powerful regular expressions. PicTracker can split and join large flies to aid in electronic transfer, and can check file CRC's to verify file integrity after transfer.
